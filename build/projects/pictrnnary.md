In an increasingly digitized world, nobody wants to play pen-and-paper games anymore. Yet this screen revolution means that the analog beauty of pencil drawings and the camaraderie shared by friends are all lost.

How can we take a classic drawing game and make it appealing to users of the digital age? Answer: PictRNNary!

PictRNNary (pronounced "picture-nary") uses an advanced RNN to do the hardest part of drawing games - actually drawing the image. Friends come together and compete to guess which animal the net is drawing, and speech detection and speaker identification enable PictRNNary to declare a winner. You can play the game with friends locally, or use the Internet if you can't get together in person.

Sometimes the net draws great images - competition is fierce for who can identify it first. And even when the images are not so great, it's still a lot of fun laughing at a hilariously bad drawing.

Oh, and when you really want to screw with the analog-digital divide... We use a 3D printer with a pen attached to its extruder head to draw out the images you see on screen.

PictRNNary seeks to become the go-to in the connected games space. In the future, our team hopes to add multi-language support in realtime, so you can compete with people across the world AND play in a new language you want to learn. "Pictionary"-esque games are among the best ways to learn a foreign language - we envision a future where language learners regularly develop their skills through fun and interactive games like this one.

tl;dr PictRNNary: making low-tech games fun using obscene amounts of high-tech stuff.
