      <DescriptionParagraph>
        I'm was a SWE working with the Google Nest team. I recently graduated from the {' '}
        <span title="UCüÖ±">University of California, Berkeley</span>{' '}
        with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Music. I enjoy writing
        software, expressing creativity through code, and building things for
        people to use. I care a lot (sometimes excessively) about user experience
        and design. With 6+ years of experience with Node.js, React,
        HTML/CSS/JS, and Python, most of what I build is for the web (though I've
        been delving into lower-level and embedded programming recently).

        When I'm not at work or otherwise too busy, you can catch me at
        hackathons, exploring the city, or making something in the kitchen.
        You might also find me dining at Taco Bell, playing {' '}
